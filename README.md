# Elixir Jump to Test

This is a simple extension that makes you able to navigate between your elixir file and its test.

It works as a charm with Phoenix Framework, but it wasn't tested with umbrella apps :thinking:

No more Cmd + P for us!

## Features

The default keybinding is `Cmd + Shift + J`
